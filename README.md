# Lottery Coding Assignment

Three files Lottery.py, Ticket.py, and Interface.py

When picking winning lottery numbers I make a structure like:

[[21], [32, 12, 8], [45, 34, 23, 55]]
where 21 was entered as a favorite number 4 time. The next sequence would be tied as favorite numbers 3 times and the next sequence is tied as a favorite number 2 times.

I would pick  the winning number by selecting 21, then randomly select the next favorite number from [32, 12, 8] and again from [45, 34, 23, 55].
